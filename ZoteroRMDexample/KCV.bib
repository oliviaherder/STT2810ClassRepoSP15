	abstract = {An estimator, {\textless}tex-math{\textgreater}\${\textbackslash}bar y'\${\textless}/tex-math{\textgreater}, of μ is developed which utilizes a priori information concerning the value of the population coefficient of variation. {\textless}tex-math{\textgreater}\${\textbackslash}bar y'\${\textless}/tex-math{\textgreater} is shown to have a smaller mean squared error than the sample mean, ȳ. A table of relative efficiencies for various coefficients of variation and sample sizes is presented.},

	abstract = {Estimation of the mean θ of a normal distribution N(θ, aθ$^{\textrm{2}}$) with known coefficient of variation a{\textless}sup{\textgreater}{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}1/2 is treated as a decision problem with squared-error loss. It is shown that all estimators linear in the sample mean x̄ and sample standard deviation s, as well as the maximum likelihood estimator ({MLE}), are dominated in risk by the admissible, minimum risk, scale equivariant estimator θ̂$_{\textrm{I}}$. A class of Bayes estimators against inverted-gamma priors is constructed, and shown to include θ̂$_{\textrm{I}}$ within its closure. All members of this latter class, as well as θ̂$_{\textrm{I}}$, can be easily computed using continued fractions.},

	abstract = {Searls in 1964 showed that when the coefficient of variation is known, the sample mean is dominated with respect to mean squared error by an improved estimator that makes use of that coefficient. In this article we illustrate that this is true for a general class of estimators. Expressions for the minimum mean squared error and the relative efficiency are given for general distributions. The improvement, as measured by relative efficiency, is seen to be independent of the form of the distribution.},
