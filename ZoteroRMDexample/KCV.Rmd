@searls_utilization_1964 showed that when the coefficient of variation is
known, the sample mean is dominated with respect to mean squared error
by an improved estimator that makes use of that coefficient. 
@gleser_estimating_1976 illustrate how knowing the proportionality
constant is equivalent to knowing the population coefficient of variation.
@arnholt_estimating_1995 showed the result from @searls_utilization_1964
holds for a general class of estimators.
